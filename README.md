This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

install node_modules - npm install
to run project - npm run dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

I completed the assignment. I tried to display suggested details in the UI but I didn't work much with css in the task becuase in the task didn't mentioned how data should be displayed.
